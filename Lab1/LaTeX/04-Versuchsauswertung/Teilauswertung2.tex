\section{Questions}
The following questions had to be answered as part of the analysis:
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] Does the correction of the apparent half solar diameter $\Phi_1$ has to be done before or after the correction of the atmospheric refraction?
\item[b)] The weather forecast always lists the air pressure reduced to sea level.  Are the refraction tables still valid
for this value or the local pressure at the site of observation?
\item[c)] How accurate (estimate the magnitude) has the time to be measured,  if one wants to obtain $b$ with an
error less than $1''$ and the observations are done at 12:00 and 15:00?
\item[d)] Which of the three solutions for $b$ is the correct one in your case? The possible combinations would result in 4 solutions.  What about the 4th solution?
\item[e)] What would be the best time for your observations? Why? Is this method suitable for any possible
observation time?
\item[f)]How can the longitude l be easily measured (by using a clock)?
\end{itemize}
